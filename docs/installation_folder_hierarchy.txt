/usr/shew
|	The installation folder. This folder holds nearly all of the files used by
|	Shewstring installs, both on the host system and in jails.
|
+ chroots
|	Contains chroot environments. Each subfolder is a separate environment.
|
+ copy_to_mfs
|	The contents of this folder are copied to /usr/shew/mfs by /etc/rc.d/shew_mfs
|	during the boot process. This folder contains the template for the mfs folder.
|	Programs that want to edit their files (such as /home folder files), but
|	shouldn't be actually allowed to make persistent changes should have their
|	files put in this folder. See /usr/shew/mfs for some more details.
|
+ data
|	Contains information that is stored through rebooting. This folder should not
|	contain application data unless it is too large for /usr/shew/sensitive. This
|	is mostly for use by the user (the only non-user use currently is for the
|	Freenet datastore). Each subfolder should have the name of the user that owns
|	it.
|
+ jails
|	Contains jailed environments. Each subfolder is a seperate environment. There
|	should be /usr/shew/jails/*/usr/shew folders with a similar hierarchy as well.
|
+ install
| |	Contains files for use by the installers.
| |
| + base_system
| |	Contains a copy of the base system from the installation DVD.
| |
| + done
| |	Notes on what functions and scripts have been run. A function or script that
| |	should only be run once will touch a file in the done hierarchy, and a check
| |	when starting each function or script will see if the process has been
| |	completed previously, in which case it will echo a complaint but not stop the
| |	installation. The done folder may contain subfolders for processes taking
| |	place in jails, and the done folder and jail subfolders may contain subfolders
| |	for processes taking place on users.
| |
| + fetch
| |	Contains files which have been fetched by misc_utils__fetch.
| |
| + install_vars.conf
| |	Contains installation variables saved from the fixit installation.
| |
| + log
| |	Contains logs from installation processes that are too long to be printed to
| |	stdout (such as compilation). If the process completes successfully, the log
| |	will get gzipped. Gzipped logs can be read using 'zcat $file | more'.
| |
| + ports.tar.gz
| |	A copy of the ports tarball provided by the user.
| |
| + resources
| |	Contains files with notes on what system resources have been allocated (such
| |	as IP addresses and loopback interfaces). Each file should take the name of
| |	the resource, and the resource used should be a bourne shell variable
| |	declaration with the name of the thing using the resource as the variable
| |	name, and resource name (such as the IP address) as the value.
| |
| + shewstring
| |	Contains the installer (not installation!) hierarchy.
| |
| + login_jail
|   |	Contains files used for logging into the jails via telnet.
|   |
|   + login.sh
|   |	The script used to log in to jails. In the installer hierarchy, this resides
|   |	in libexec/x/misc/login.sh and the function that installs it resides in
|   |	libexec/x/login.sh
|   |
|   + *_pass.conf
|	Contains passwords for logging in as users in each jail. The filename should
|	take the form of ${jail}_pass.conf and the passwords should take the form of
|	variable declarations with the user name as the variable name and the password
|	as the value. Good passwords can be generated by
|	'dd if=/dev/random count=2 | md5'.
|
+ mfs
|	The mounted memory filesystem for the host or jail environment (each mfs is
|	seperately mounted). /home /tmp and /var are currently linked to here (all
|	other folders except /usr/shew/data and /usr/shew/sensitive should be read
|	only). The contents of this folder may be swapped, but the swap space is
|	mounted with a one time password.
|
+ permanent
|	Contains read-only files used by programs. Each subfolder should have the name
|	of the user that owns it.
|
+ sensitive
  |	Contains read-write files used by programs that need to be kept through
  |	rebooting (such as emails). If a program does not support sending files here
  |	via some configuration option, then they should be symbolically linked from
  |	its main folder. Not all programs will follow links properly. The programs
  |	that do not follow links properly should have their whole main folder sent
  |	here, but the files that shouldn't persist through reboots should be cleared
  |	at shutdown by audit.sh (see *.allow for more details). Each subfolder should
  |	have the name of the user that owns it.
  |
  + *.allow
	Contains a list of regular expressions that should EXACTLY match every folder,
	subfolder and file that should be kept through rebooting. All other files will
	be securely deleted (via 'rm -P'). See libexec/host/misc/audit.sh for more
	information on how this is done.
