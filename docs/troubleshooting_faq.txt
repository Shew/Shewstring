I am not happy with the configuration of one of the programs; how do I change
it?

  There are several ways to do this.
  Before installation:
   * Edit Shewstring and/or the installer (quick and dirty).
   * Set your own values in custom_variables.conf for variables that provide the
     paths of configuration files and folders to some alternative you have provided
     in the customization folder (recommended).
  After installation, but before first boot:
   * Just directly edit the files. You may need to do 'chflags noschg' on the ones
     in the /usr/shew/sensitive folders, and set them back using 'chflags schg'
     after you are done editing them.
  After you start using the system:
   * Reboot and start the system in 'Single user mode' (found on the
     'Welcome to FreeBSD' screen while booting).
     Log in as root.
     Mount the filesystems using 'mount -a; mount -u -o rw /; mount -u -o rw /usr'
     Make your changes.
     Reboot the system using 'reboot'.
     Do not remount the partitions while the system is booted in multiuser mode!
     Some programs will overwrite their configuration files (e.g. Freenet) if the
     system is made read-write.

My installation has stopped on 'Making ...', what do I do?

  Try restarting install.sh. If that doesn't work, you can look at the log for
  make in /usr/shew/install/log. Sometimes make downloads a corrupted file and
  does not handle deleting it properly, which you can try 'rm -R
  /usr/shew/jails/compile/usr/ports/distfiles'. If it still gives you trouble,
  you might try downloading a newer ports.tar.gz and start a new installation.

My installation has stopped on some other part.

  Try restarting install.sh. If that doesn't work, start install.sh with the
  argument 'debug' and examine 'tail 100 /tmp/shewstring_log.txt' (WARNING: This
  may log sensitive things like passwords). If you cannot figure out what the
  problem is from the log, then you can send Shew an email.

My installation has stopped, but it gives a different error when restarting.

  Most functions in Shewstring will try and detect if they have already been run
  and skip without an error if they have. If an installation hits an error in
  the middle of a function, it might have passed some code that it can't execute
  properly twice. You can try putting comments in the code, but unless you know
  what you're doing, it might be better to send Shew an email.
