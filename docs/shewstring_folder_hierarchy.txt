shewstringv*
|	The root folder. The version takes the form major.minor.misc (for example:
|	Shewstringv0.1.1). Major denotes a large change in the functioning of the
|	install process. Minor denotes a change in the functioning of one or more of
|	the installers. Misc. denotes a small change which does not change the
|	behavior of any of the installers. The root folder contains files that are
|	important for every user to look at.
|
+ devel
| |	Contains information important to developers.
| |
| + customization
| |	Contains files for putting in installer customization folders that may be
| |	useful to developers.
| |
| + scripts
|	Contains scripts which are useful to use when doing various tasks in
|	developing Shewstring, Shewstring installers, or preparing a release.
|
+ docs
|	Contains documentation for Shewstring itself. Systems installed by a
|	Shewstring installer should provide their own documentation.
|
+ installers
| |	Contains folders for the installers and their associated files. An installer
| |	calls the various scripts and functions in Shewstring to install a secure
| |	FreeBSD distro. An installer may have its own folder hierarchy too.
| |
| + */customization
| |	Contains scripts and files a user has added or modified. All scripts with a
| |	name ending in '.sh' or with the first line containing '#!/bin/sh' will be ran
| |	after the installer has finished. A script can simply be dropped into this
| |	folder to add finishing touches to the installed distro.
| |
| + */query
|	Contains query files. Each of these files defines a question which is asked to
|	the user just before running the associated installer. See
|	menu_utils__prompt_option in lib/menu_utils.sh for more detail.
|
+ lib
| |	Contains libraries (shell scripts containing functions only) which are used to
| |	do general tasks in Shewstring or Freebsd, such as setting up jails, prompting
| |	the user, or compiling programs.
| |
| + apps
| |	Apps files for the lib scripts. These files are used to configure the build
| |	options of the ports. See ports_pkgs_utils__configure_port in
| |	lib/ports_pkgs_utils.sh for more detail.
| |
| + rc.d
|	Contains scripts for starting programs that will be placed in '/etc/rc.d'. See
|	'man rc' for more detail.
|
+ libexec
| |	Contains libraries and executeable scripts for setting up particular programs
| |	or subsystems in FreeBSD.
| |
| + darknets
| |	Contains scripts for setting up darknets (anonymity networks) and their
| |	associated programs.
| |
| + fixit
| |	Contains scripts used to set up FreeBSD in the fixit CLI live-filesystem
| |	(which is provided with the FreeBSD installation media). Most other scripts
| |	will be used in a post-boot system once the fixit scripts have been completed.
| |	The fixit scripts do things like installing filesystems and the base FreeBSD
| |	system.
| |
| + host
| |	Contains scripts used to set up basic FreeBSD subsystems, like networking.
| |
| + jailed_nox
| |	Contains scripts used to set up jailed programs that do not use X11. These are
| |	probably mostly scripts to set up daemons.
| |
| + jailed_x
| |	Contains scripts used to set up jailed programs that do use X11. These are
| |	probably mostly scripts useful only to desktop systems. They can be reached by
| |	logging into the jail via telnet. See x_login__install_login in
| |	libexec/x/login.sh for more information.
| |
| + lockdown
| |	Contains scripts to perform final system hardening before ending the
| |	installation process.
| |
| + nojailed_nox
| |	Contains scripts used to set up unjailed programs that do not use X11. These
| |	are probably mostly CLI programs useful to the user.
| |
| + nojailed_x
| |	Contains scripts used to set up unjailed programs that do use X11. These are
| |	probably mostly desktop environments and their associated graphical
| |	applications.
| |
| + x
| |	Contains scripts used to set up X11 servers and their associated programs.
| |
| + */apps
| |	Apps files for the libexec scripts. These files are used to configure the
| |	build options of the ports. See ports_pkgs_utils__configure_port in
| |	lib/ports_pkgs_utils.sh for more detail.
| |
| + */home
| |	Contains home folder hierarchies. A folder will be associated with a script in
| |	the parent directory, which will empty the hierarchy into the home folder of
| |	the user it is setting up.
| |
| + */makefiles
| |	Contains extra makefiles for Shewstring which are not found in the FreeBSD
| |	ports system.
| |
| + */misc
| |	Contains extra files associated with scripts in the parent directory.
| |
