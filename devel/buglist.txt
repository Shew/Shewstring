Security problems:
  Xorg can leak information between client programs, and it lacks proper authentication.
  XDM and Xauth are broken!
  Users cannot log in correctly if home is not world readable (this is fairly minor).
  Redirected 127.0.0.1 addresses in tor_normal jail does not work, but other 127.0.0.0/8 addresses do (e.g. FProxy).
  Host (but not jailed) Abiword does not load documents correctly: the letters are all jumbled together in a small space.

Non-Shewstring bugs:
  GELI ignores pipe. The user gets the prompt anyway.
  The GELI boot message is covered up by system messages.
  Redirecting the output of an empty braced statement in sh results in a segmentation fault instead of an error, even when using 'sh -n':
    { } > file
  Mousepad search & search/replace breaks after first use.
  Pinentry (for GPG) has a 'feature' which prevents passwords from being pasted into it.
  Symbolic linking does not work properly with: GnuPG, Liferea, Pidgin, Sylpheed.
  XFCE sometimes makes duplicate desktop items (when only one file exists).
  Freenet:
    Freenet requires /var/tmp to be mounted allowing execution.
    The FreeBSD wrapper for Freenet does not download correctly.
