Shewstring v1.0.3
	Increased partition sizes, because they were pretty close to the maximum.
	GnuPG/GPA has been moved to its own user. Before it used the same user as Sylpheed, but now the permissions problem has been fixed.
	Firefox should now recognize MIMEtypes that are openable by Abiword, Evince, and VLC.
	Added a new user script scripts/maintenance.sh, which will maintain and update the installation. It is only partially completed, however (does not yet update ports, ExcludeExitNodes, or I2P). This fixed a nasty problem where Freenet would eventually stop working, due to their policy of blocking nodes with old versions from accessing the network.
	Use portsnap instead of ports tarballs. Advantages: nobody has to deal with ports tarballs anymore; more secure method of getting ports skeleton than tarballs. Disadvantages: devs can no longer ensure that users are getting a specific tested version of software, which can lead to problems with broken ports and software behavior changes.
	Misc. bugfixes, tweaks and updates.

Shewstring v1.0.2
	I2P has been fixed, and support has been dramatically improved (with more than an order of magnatude increase in efficiency; wrapper and jbigi work), thanks mostly to the I2P devs.
	Fix a major bug where wireless did not work due to a problem with PF.
	Misc. XFCE improvements.
	Pidgin is now allowed to keep 'pounces.xml' across reboots.
	Added new Shew GPG key.
	Misc. bugfixes, tweaks and updates.

Shewstring v1.0.1
	Vidalia now works, thanks to the Tor community.
	Fixed Tor hidden services.
	Add anti-tracking entries in Adblock Plus.
	Fixed a bug where calling some scripts with a relative path instead of an absolute one caused them to malfunction.
	Added two scripts for users: scripts/backup.sh and scripts/restore.sh to create and restore encrypted 7z backups of your Shewstring files.
	You can now install Shewstring using only one removable medium, instead of two.
	Add ExcludeExitNodes entries generated by InspecTor.
	Protect users of scripts/upload_ftp.sh from file modification time leaks.
	audit.sh now securely wipes the trash folder in /usr/shew/data, if it exists.
	Fixed XFBurn.
	Many programs updated, and configurations tweaked.
	Many small bugs fixed.
	Regressions:
		Some window status changes are laggy.
		I2P has stopped working.
