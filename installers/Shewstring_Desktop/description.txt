Shewstring Desktop is an installation which provides a very secure desktop
system with tools for encrypted and anonymized communications. It balances
between the storing of no information (thus leaving few local traces of your
activities) and storing information (enabling you to have better continuous
communications). It does this by segregating all programs into different jails,
and giving them each their own user, and then separating the programs' files
into write-only files, temorary write files (changes are lost after shutting
down), and a very few read-write files. In addition, programs are chosen
carefully with security in mind and are further locked down in their
configuration. Anonymity is preserved by forcing the programs with a firewall to
only use the communications channels that are allowed for their jail (one jail
may allow only non-anonymized communications, and another may allow ONLY
anonymized communications).

Host system features:
  * Full disk encryption and authentication requiring both a key file (stored on
    a thumb drive along with the boot code) ensures that no information or code
    is exposed to an attacker's attempts to read or tamper with the information.
  * A MAC changer ensures that your networking hardware's identification is not
    known to the network, and uses realistic (but random) MAC addresses to
    ensure that it is hard to detect that the address is spoofed. The spoofed
    address expires after a random interval between one and two weeks long, and
    then a new one is generated. Other networking tweaks make the system
    resistant to fingerprinting (e.g. Nmap is unable to detect the computers
    operating system)
  * A restrictive firewall (PF) ensures that no unauthorized communications can
    occur.
  * A NTP server corrects the computer's clock, ensuring that the computer
    cannot be fingerprinted because of an odd time setting.
  * A local DNS server provides authentication of non-anonymized DNS resolutions
    via the DNS Security Extensions, and bypasses ISP control of DNS.
  * XFCE provides clean and light window management.
  * Basic document, image, audio and video viewing, and other utilities.
  * KeepassX provides an additional layer of encryption for your passwords.

Anonymity networks:
  * Tor is provided in three flavors:
      tor_normal provides a vanilla configuration of Tor.
      tor_two_hop provides a faster configuration of Tor, at the expense of
      anonymity.
      tor_zero_dirtiness ensures that tunnels are not reused, however it can
      only be used with programs that make a very low number of connections
      (like email). This provides resistance against the correlation of your
      identities.
  * I2P provides access to the I2P network.
  * Freenet provides access to the Freenet network.
  * Vidalia provides GUI access to Tor, and Firefox provides GUI access to I2P
    and Freenet. [NOTE: Vidalia is currently broken on FreeBSD and is disabled.]

Jails:
  * nat_insecure jail provides tools for communicating non-anonymously.
    Installed programs are: Firefox for browsing with Torbutton, Gnash (for
    Flash viewing), Adblock, Beef TACO, HTTPS everywhere, Noscript, and
    Perspectives. [NOTE: Gnash is broken with Youtube et al and is disabled.]
  * nat_secure jail provides tools for maintaining identities non-anonymously.
    Installed programs are: Sylpheed with GnuPG and GPA for end-to-end encrypted
    emails; Pidgin with OTR for end-to-end encrypted chat messaging.
  * tor_fast jail provides tools for communicating semi-anonymously. The jail
    can only access the Internet through tor_two_hop. Firfox with Torbutton,
    Adblock, Beef TACO, HTTPS everywhere, Noscript, and Perspectives; Liferea
    for feed reading.
  * tor_normal provides tools for communicating anonymously. The jail can only
    access the Internet through tor_normal, but can also access I2P and Freenet
    HTTP/S. Firefox with Torbutton, Noscript, and HTTPS Everywhere.
  * tor_pseudonymous_1 jail provides tools for maintaining identities
    anonymously. The jail can only access the Internet through
    tor_zero_dirtiness. Sylpheed with GnuPG and GPA; Pidgin with OTR.
  * tor_pseudonymous_2 jail provides the same tools as tor_pseudonymous_1, but
    can also access I2P mail and I2P IRC.
