Perspectives is a plugin for the Mozilla and Firefox browsers to offer another
way of authenticating SSL certificates besides the certificate authority
system. It uses a set of notaries which keep track of whether certificates
have been seen before and how long they have been seen for. It can be used to
protect against man in the middle attacks when using the certificate authority
system or with self signed certificates.
